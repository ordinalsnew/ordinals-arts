- Harto
  
  A young artist based at Spanish. Currently Harto has launched three ga on Ordinals.
  1. [SATS](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/sats)
     The first ordinals created by Harto. It's a png rather than a html file. Holding SATS give collectors perks of all future ordinals curated by vivid. The supply is 99.
  2. [The Golden Ratio](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/the-golden-ratio)
     The supply is 420. Maybe the best ga on ordinals.
